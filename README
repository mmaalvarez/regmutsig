Characterization of signatures that inform DNA repair deficiencies in cancer

Different samples of the same tumor type can differ in their across-genome mutation rate spectrum, due to having undergone different combinations of mutational processes, such as those arising from DNA repair pathway deficiencies. These mutational processes could be summarized by SBS-based signatures, but most of these are convoluted (i.e. comprising several processes). Also, SBS-based signatures rely on knowledge of the DNA repair deficiencies of the training samples, in order to assign a signature to a specific aetiology. 

In our approach, each sample is summarized by a specific profile, which consists on a vector of regression coefficients from the associations between local mutation rates and the local activities/abundances of each DNA repair mark included in the model. We also account for factors known to play a role in mutation rate spectrum, such as replication time and trinucleotide context. Then, via non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) we reduce the dimensions of the all-samples coefficient profile matrix into signatures: each signature will have a different exposure in each sample, so sample outliers could potentially have a DNA repair pathway deficiency that results in an altered mutation pattern, and therefore in an unexpected association between mutation rate and DNA repair activity.
