TODO
	in cases where 1 signature (similar SBS spectra) gets split into 2 signatures (regional spectra) --> check exposures of the split signatures: are they associated with different genotypes in our cell line dataset?
	
	An example of 'bi-cross-validation' (blanking out a few cells here and there) usage for mutational signatures extraction. https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009119
	Perhaps interesting – the conceptually similar paper I mentioned, looking at regional distribution to decompose signatures (germline variants) https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7408  It uses the „reflection test“ method to select genomic resolution (a metaparameter of the method) and to discard individual signatures – that test would be related to ours splitting into odd/even chromosomes.

	WARNING
		..b1..R script doesn't check if a sample does not have any mutation at all (which would be unexpected anyways)


UPD10: model_5

	only tumor samples:
		500 colorectal	filter(OriginalType=="Colorectum" & tissue=="colorectum")
		500 lung NSCC	filter(OriginalType=="Lung_Non-small cell carcinoma")

	added features
		DHS
			positive control: UV-mutated melanomas and tobacco-mutated lung cancers should have an enrichment of mutations in DHS regions
		hairpins mutated by A3A
		several nonB DNA structures
		first few PC components of Maia's matrix of presence/absence of mut. clusters (same event or recurrent) within 10kb windows
			each component ideally should represent 1/few mutagenic agents, such as AID etc. (A3A not since A3A-target motifs were removed a priori)

UPD9: model_4
	calculated each feature's cutoff score based on the score interval with a maximum decrease of normalized mut load across all pooled samples
		using only repliseq level6 (earliest) to remove RT effect (i.e. early RT potentially correlated to high scores o some features)
	model_null now completely shuffles scores across ranges per feature, rather than just shift +50kbp as this wasn't enough
	tried -+1 score bin for cutoff, to see whether it matters a lot for final results, but it failed since in many cases there were only 1 bin (high or low), if want to fix this and try again pipelines are in resources/OLD_models/cutoff_minus_plus_1/ (4b is -1 and 4c is +1)
  ICA and kurtosis
  Also kurtosis of NMF signature exposures: additional criterion to determine #factors×K in heatmaps
  NMF: split genome in 2 parts (odd/even chromosomes) to check consistency
  Matching to Cosmic signatures: show 1stmatch+2ndmatch+maybe 3rd
MUSE-XAE - https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.23.562664v1.full.pdf 

UPD8: model_3
	try different genome binarization (per feature): 'low' == covered_genome>75% & FE>=1

UPD7: model_null (from model_2 onwards)
	shift the coordinates of all ranges of each regional feature +50kbp, so that the somatic mutation rates stop correlating the feature levels in all samples (and therefore the reg. p-vals are all similar (and probably much larger than 0), i.e. following a uniform distribution)

UPD6: model2
	Poisson instead of OR (logistic) both for reg features and SBS96
	feature abundance level genomic binarization: "high" regions vs. "low +-50kbp flanking high regions" regions, without overlaps
	Petljak data added
	compare PCA of regional+SBS NMF exposures vs. PCA of SBS-only NMF exposures, see whether the clusterings change and regional can give some extra info
	In random forests (NMF and autoenc), I downsample the normal samples (i.e. with a '0') to match the number of case samples ('1's)

UPD5:
	Analyze also Zou and Kucab in same pipeline as Marcel's, since each sample is independently analyzed
		- But split the downstream analyses (PCA, NMF, AE, RFs) by dataset, as until now
	Add the 29 ENCODEC proteins (gpt4)
		- Pooling 2-3 top tier cell lines when available
		- keep without trinuc matching
	Add other DNA repair stuff I have
		- DSB
		- NER (UV, BPDE, platinum)
	Add H3K36me3 from ENCODE (keep also Fran's)
	Keep both RMDflat and Repliseq
	Trinuc matching:
		- begin analyses with original tracks, i.e. without having been trinuc matched
		- dont overlap tracks, keep them in separate Channels, but chromosomes are not channeled anymore
		- within each "track Channel":
			- binarize whole genome's trinucleotides into 2 bins/"ranges" (high and low level of feature), i.e. collapsing all ranges into 2 pseudoranges from which we only care about the frequencies of each trinucleotide (32 types)
			- do the trinuc matching (1st on frequencies, then actually removing trinucleotides, as now) between each feature's 2 bins
			- calculate the offset for that feature (instead of doing a general offset for all features overlapped as until now), so there will be 2 values, 1 per bin
		- merge each sample's somatic data (separately through a second set of Channels) to each feature (with the original ranges), collapse again into 2 pseudoranges/bins, and append to its offset when it's ready
			- run regression per sample and feature
		- colbind results
	Logistic regression instead of NB, now that I just have a contingency table (same as with SBS96):

		feature_level	SNVs	non-SNV trinucs
		low 			323 	213432434
		high 			89 		32423412

UPD4:
	Added SIRT6
	good mappability regions from /g/strcombio/fsupek_cancer3/malvarez/chromatin_info/good_mappability_regions/k50.umap.parsed.bed
		applied in 2_trinuc_freqs.R, to map_features (generated in 1_*.R)
	removed 1 sample per pair of "technical replicates", Maia re-did calling on the kept one per pair
	removed the "chromatin_features" mode/option, now all features are in dnarep_marks.csv
	removed median score calculation and binarization, as since I do trinuc matching I already binarize the scores for the matching

UPD3:
	RT: use Marina's score
	Exclude RNAseq and DNase
	Single regressions (not pairwise)
	Resampling from CI 80%
	AE: #hidden layers, #neurons in hidden layers, #neurons in encoded layer

UPD2: doing PCA etc also for regional features alone, without SBS

UPD1: only marcel data


1) full simulation

	- grid of PCAs with stabilities for 4 different (each):

		- #features

		- #tumors

		- #normals
		
		- mean #SNVs in target bins

		- mean #SNVs in nontarget bins

	- PCA (and NMF and AE) perfectly classify samples with

	  	"number_features" = 8
	  	"number_tumors_per_feature" = 20
	  	"total_number_normal_samples" = 100
	  	"mean_fraction_of_nt_at_risk_mutated_in_target_bins" = 2e-5 	--> if total nt at risk 3e9, and 256 bins, ~240 muts at each of the 128 target bins (i.e. "high" for featureX) == 30K muts, in line with Marcel's with more mutations (max thereof ~40K?) 
	  	"mean_fraction_of_nt_at_risk_mutated_in_nontarget_bins" = 5e-8	--> much lower muts in nontarget bins, but still some (~0.6 at each bin == 150 muts in total)

			This uses realistic number_features (8) and (kind of) mut rate in target bins

			But it uses an unrealistic/idealized too clean mutagenesis, i.e. mutations are strictly enriched in the 128 "featureX-high" bins in featureX-/- samples, etc


2) real data 

	 i) Marcel

	ii) Zou (BERko + MMRko + control samples) -- separately from Marcel's (there is batch effect)

	- 2 types of coefficients matrices

		a) Only logistic regression coefficients of SBS (i.e. binning genome in 96 bins --> the SBS)

			- reuses the offset table from b)

		b) "a" combined with the pairwise-simple-lowest coefficients of regional MMR+BER genome features

			- 'pairwise-simple-lowest': 

				- e.g. #SNVs ~ MSH6 + RepliSeq + offset --> MSH6.w.RepliSeq β and RepliSeq.w.MSH6 β
				- For e.g. MSH6, we have 10 × MSH6.w.* (for 10 features)
				- Keep the MSH6.w.* with closest-to-zero coefficient, and call it MSH6: the 'most corrected'
				- In the end the coeff. matrix has 10 'pairwise-simple-lowest' coefficients + 96 SBS coefficients

			-  reuses the the 96 SBS regression coefficients from a): these are actually (or should be) the same/similar in model 'only SBS' and model 'regional+SBS', since it is using the same data

		- CRUCIAL: does b) increase/build on the ability of a) to classify dMMR and/or dBER samples based on the expected gene-/- effects?

					- see docs.google.com/document/d/1_kvwdevPnalTsKLTsCB7a1tjTPj7Zo_dnJbZiECuYHo/edit

			- PCA	
					Compare stability scores (cosine distance between samples, partition around medoids, mean silhouette) between a) and b)

					In b), decomposed each PC's % variance explained into that explained by SBS and that by the regional

			- NMF
					Compare random forest's scores (OOB, acc, prec) for classifying dMMR vs. MMRwt and/or dBER vs. BERwt -based on best model's (nFact×k with highest stability scores) exposures- between a) and b)

			- AE
					removed the "Variational" part of Mischan's code (see resources/autoencoder/vae_to_ae__gpt4; there, simulations_VAE/ contains the previous code) -- instead, using a diff. permuted table per epoch

					Compare random forest's scores -based on latent layer means- between a) and b)

Split Zou and Marcel

zou info from /g/strcombio/fsupek_cancer3/malvarez/WGS_tumors/somatic_variation/cell_lines/zou_2021/processed/sample_gene_ko.tsv


UPD6: I didn't do the abs(beta)>10 --> 0, as this removed a lot of signal. Maybe some are failed regressions, but most not


UPD5:
	- added BER features OGG1 and NEIL1

	- will compare signatures based only on SBS vs SBS+regional features (see whether the latter adds some value)


UPD4:
	- added 96 SBS (interaction between each trinuc and all the others, stratified by nt_at_risk and mut_nts)

	- removed tumor samples for now

UPD3:
	- added interactions between every pair of features (but keeping all individual features in the regression, although their coefficients are ignored afterwards)

	- increased MSS samples by 2-fold (i.e. ×2 times the n of MSI tumors)

	- ignored 58 samples whose simple regression fails (failed_regressions.tsv)


UPD 2: tumors mut burdens are downsampled to tops 20SNVs/Mbp


UPDATE: added MMRwt samples

	Zou: 8 controls + the low burden MSK0.123_s1

	tumors: 162 MSS samples

			keeping source and tissue proportions in 162 MSI samples

			then prioritize the purple's msStatus and msIndelsPerMb ("MSS" that have the lowest msIndelsPerMb) rather than random
